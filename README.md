# My Portfolio

## Current version

More like [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io). I didn't want to copy anyone's design but while designing and building my designs become more like them only without my own creative thoughts. Very disappointing.

While building this portfolio I thought this is going to be good but it turned out that it seems like a cheap copy and little mix of silliness.

## Future versions

Recently I came across a portfolio of [Mayur Bhoi](https://mayur.wtf). Crazy! It is crazy. So clean UI, clean design idea which is well executed. Simple yet elegant. I'm really inspired by this design, so again I'll be changing my portfolio design but this time I'll add my own stuff too instead of blatantly copying others' portfolios.

Whenever I'll get time I'll be updating the designs first. In doing so, I'll be learning a little bit about designing too. Mostly, I hope that I get selected as the full-time employee at Router Protocol.
